FreeDOS Edit 0.7b

Based on DFLAT TUI toolkit as described in Dr. Dobbs Journal (DDJ)
See DFLAT.TXT for more information.

Compiling:
Tested with Borland's Turbo C 2.01 (TC2), Turbo C++ 1.01 (TC++1), 
Turbo C/C++ 3.0 (TC3), and Borland C/C++ 3.1 (TC3/BC3)
Should also work with later versions.

QUICKSTART:
- flicker control in video.c used assembly language, removed this.
  TASM is no longer needed.
- calendar "day of week" calculations and other mktime() things
  are now done by a builtin function. Turbo C 2.01 did not have
  mktime and you had to compile without calendar there formerly.
  The strftime() function is no longer necessary either.
- you can now (EDIT 0.7) use either the old shift-ins/del, ctrl-ins
  and alt-backspace or the new ctrl-v/x, ctrl-c and ctrl-z keys.
  Their meanings are, respectively: paste, cut, copy, undo. The
  ctrl-ins and alt-backspace keys do not work on XT 84 key systems.
- the /B (force monochrome) and /H (force high resolution mode)
  options now work (EDIT 0.7b) :-). You also have /R global read-
  only mode now, inspired by Joe's EDIT 0.8 / 0.81 / 0.82 version.

Details:

To compile, 1st edit MAKEFILE to match your compiler, followed by
running 'make'.  You may wish to then run clean to remove object
files and lib files, the executables (*.exe) will still be available.
(If compiling with TC3 or earlier? under NT, you may need to ensure
your environment space is not to cluttered, i.e. unset unneeded
environment variables, e.g. 'set PROCESSOR_IDENTIER=', etc. before make.)

Once compiled you may wish to compress with an executable compressor
such as UPX.  If upx.exe is in your path, after make or instead of
'make all' you may run 'make upx' to build and then compress edit.exe


Known Issues:

- When reading or writing a file, tabs are converted to spaces. Since
  0.6d, you can select to read and keep tabs as normal unexpanded chars.

- The beep() function in console.c produces warnings with TC3 if outp
  macro is defined (you can #undef outp to remove them for TC3, but
  TC++1 does not have an outp function only the macro). Very lowlevel!

- No support for Ctrl-Del in 0.6a..e series and 0.7a..b series.
  No support for Alt-BackSpace in 0.6a..e series and 0.7, fixed in 0.7a.
  Characters 0x89 and 0x8c (\t and \f | 0x80) were treated specially in
  the display code, a leftover from special-tab mode of Joe's EDIT 0.6-
  0.8x, fixed in 0.7c (edit 0.6a..0.7c does not use special-tab mode).
